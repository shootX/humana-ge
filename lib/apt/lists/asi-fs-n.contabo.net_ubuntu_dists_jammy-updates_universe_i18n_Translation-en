Package: 2to3
Description-md5: 99d0c4da87ac7a830ee863ab2b2d2e40
Description-en: 2to3 binary using python3
 2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a
 series of fixers to transform it into valid Python 3.x code. The standard
 library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code. 2to3
 supporting library lib2to3 is, however, a flexible and generic library, so it
 is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3. lib2to3 could also be adapted
 to custom applications in which Python code needs to be edited automatically.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Python 3 2to3 version (currently v3.10).

Description-en: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - transitional package
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.

 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as they can be can written to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

Package: boinc-manager
Description-md5: 18cdf3bcfd01c25a71225cc0291571cd
Description-en: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

Package: boinc-screensaver
Description-md5: ba066f78393e8713c0e55232ad35eddf
Description-en: screen saver auto-controlling volunteer computing
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

Package: busybox
Description-md5: b7707908219c331294f3f9e8d926a9dc
Description-en: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

  - To be a repeatable and predictable tool (rather than doing most of the
    work and you have to clean up the output to get it working.)
  - To deliver quick and small version increments.
  - The ultimate milestone is to be able to compile the SQLite3 source
    code and have it working without modification.

 Since the daemon doesn't need to startup every time it wants to update the
 values it's very fast and easy on the system. Also, the statistics are very
 fine grained since the files are updated every 10 seconds by default.
 .
 This package contains the following utility:
 .
   * collectdctl: Control interface for collectd
   * collectd-nagios: Nagios plugin for querying collectd

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

 Drkonqi shows a dialog for dealing with application crashes.
 .
 Drkonqi also doesn't technically require a process to actually crash, you
 can simply run it manually on any old pid. Do note that in most cases you
 only need to define the pid, however not giving certain cmdline options can
 change behavior somewhat drastically (e.g. kdeinit vs. notkdeinit behaves
 radically different as far as process name detection goes) . Drkonqi has a
 number of backends that may be used. Backends are stacked by order of
 preference, backends in the directory of the binary are most preferred.
 This means that you can dump debuggers/internal/ into your build's bin/
 directory and override for example gdb. This essentially allows you to
 replace the gdb debugger with a cat of a fixture file to not have to trace
 live processes at all.

Package: elpa-protobuf-mode
Description-md5: 5d24efe0475e2f840cf889eba9b49a37
Description-en: Emacs addon for editing protocol buffers
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package provides an emacs major mode for editing files in protocol
 buffers format. It features syntax highlighting and auto-indentation.

Description-md5: b909bca5113c0484e6b8f6dc555941a4
Description-en: fast, extensible, versatile event router for Suricata's EVE-JSON format
 The Fast, Extensible, Versatile Event Router (FEVER) is a tool for fast
 processing of events from Suricata's JSON EVE output. What is meant by
 'processing' is defined by a number of modular components, for example
 facilitating fast ingestion into a database. Other processors implement
 collection, aggregation and forwarding of various metadata (e.g.
 aggregated and raw flows, passive DNS data, etc.) as well as performance
 metrics.
 .
 It is meant to be used in front of (or as a replacement for) general-purpose
 log processors like Logstash to increase event throughput as observed on
 sensors that see a lot of traffic.

 ffcvt - ffmpeg convert wrapper to make it simple to do high efficiency
 audio/video compression (Opus/H.265) encoding, and for youtube as well.
 .
 The next-generation High Efficiency Video codec, HEVC and VP9 can produce
 videos visually comparable to libx264's, but in about half the size;
 Meanwhile the Opus audio codec is becoming the best thing ever for
 compressing audio -- A 64K Opus audio stream is comparable to mp3 files of
 128K to 256K bandwidth.
 The ffcvt makes use of such fantastic high efficiency audio/video
 codec/encoding capability while shielding people from the
 complicated ffmpeg command line option settings, while versatile
 and powerful enough to allow advanced users to touch every corner
 of audio/video encoding.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Description-md5: d8185b2340aa290370f7d26752bfc0d3
Description-en: GObject introspection bindings for libmalcontent
 malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible
 to non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is used,
 a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
 administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
 will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
 being too violent.
 .
 This is not a security boundary, and a sufficiently technically advanced user
 may always work around these parental controls. malcontent is not a mandatory
 access control (MAC) system like AppArmor or SELinux. However, its correct use
 by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or
 accidentally having access to content which they shouldn’t.

Package: go-qrcode
Description-md5: daf569259639d968fb48bda535768b1e
Description-en: QR Code encoder (Go program)
 Package qrcode implements a QR Code encoder in Go language.
 .
 A QR Code is a matrix (two-dimensional) barcode. Arbitrary content may
 be encoded, with URLs being a popular choice :)
 .
 Each QR Code contains error recovery information to aid reading damaged
 or obscured codes. There are four levels of error recovery: Low, medium,
 high and highest. QR Codes with a higher recovery level are more robust
 to damage, at the cost of being physically larger.
 .
 The maximum capacity of a QR Code varies according to the content encoded
 and the error recovery level. The maximum capacity is 2,953 bytes, 4,296
 alphanumeric characters, 7,089 numeric digits, or a combination of these.
 .
 This package contains the command-line tool qrcode.

Description-en: library for running and interacting with trusted collections
 Notary is a project that allows anyone to have trust over arbitrary
 collections of data.
 .
 The Notary project comprises a server (cmd/notary-server) and a client
 (cmd/notary) for running and interacting with trusted collections.
 .
 Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
 publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
 with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
 enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.
 .
 With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
 secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
 push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.
 .
 Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure
 channel, can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror,
 relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity
 of the received content.
 .

Description-md5: e3768a14a261164294314df9bb71bf99
Description-en: Reliable project licenses detector (library)
 It scans the given directory for license files, normalizes and hashes them
 and outputs all the fuzzy matches with the list of reference texts.  The
 returned names follow SPDX standard.
 .
 Why? There are no similar projects which can be compiled into a native binary
 without dependencies and also support the whole SPDX license database
 (≈400 items). This implementation is also fast, requires little memory, and
 the API is easy to use.
 .
 The detection algorithm is not template matching; this directly implies that
 go-license-detector does not provide any legal guarantees. The intended area
 of it's usage is data mining.

 Mender Artifacts Library Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA)
 software updater for embedded Linux devices. Mender comprises a client
 running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages
 deployments across many devices.
 .
 This repository contains the artifacts library, which is used by the
 Mender client, command line interface, server and for build integration
 with the Yocto Project.
 .
 The artifacts library makes it easy to programmatically work with a
 Mender artifact, which is a file that can be recognized by its .mender
 suffix. Mender artifacts can contain binaries, metadata, checksums,
 signatures and scripts that are used during a deployment. The artifact
 format acts as a wrapper, and uses the tar format to bundle several
 files into one.
 .
 In its simplest form, an artifact contains just a rootfs image, along
 with its checksum, id and device type compatibility.
 .
 The artifacts library might also be useful for other updaters or
 purposes. We are always happy to see other uses of it!
 .
 Mender logo Getting started To start using Mender, we recommend that
 you begin with the Getting started section in the Mender documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/).  Using the library You can use the parser
 and reader in go in the standard way:
 .
 import (
         "github.com/mendersoftware/mender-artifact/parser"
         "github.com/mendersoftware/mender-artifact/reader"

Description-en: Builds container images using Dockerfile as input
 This library supports using the Dockerfile syntax to build OCI & Docker
 compatible images, without invoking a container build command such
 as buildah bud or docker build. It is intended to give clients more
 control over how they build container images, including:
  - Instead of building one layer per line, run all instructions in the
    same container
  - Set HostConfig settings like network and memory controls that are
    not available when running container builds
  - Mount external files into the build that are not persisted as part
    of the final image (i.e. "secrets")
  - If there are no RUN commands in the Dockerfile, the container is
    created and committed, but never started.  The final image should be
    99.9% compatible with regular container builds, but bugs are always
    possible.

 ksuid is an efficient, comprehensive, battle-tested Go library for
 generating and parsing a specific kind of globally unique identifier
 called a *KSUID*. This library serves as its reference implementation.
 .
 What is a KSUID?
 .
 KSUID is for K-Sortable Unique IDentifier. It is a kind of globally
 unique identifier similar to a RFC 4122 UUID, built from the ground-up
 to be "naturally" sorted by generation timestamp without any special
 type-aware logic.
 .
 In short, running a set of KSUIDs through the UNIX sort command will
 result in a list ordered by generation time.
 .
 Why use KSUIDs?
 .
 There are numerous methods for generating unique identifiers, so why
 KSUID?
 .
  1. Naturally ordered by generation time
  2. Collision-free, coordination-free, dependency-free
  3. Highly portable representations

 github.com/tdewolff/minify is a minifier package written in Go.
 It provides HTML5, CSS3, JS, JSON, SVG and XML minifiers and an interface
 to implement any other minifier.
 .
 Minification is the process of removing bytes from a file (such as
 whitespace) without changing its output and therefore shrinking
 its size and speeding up transmission over the Internet and possibly
 parsing.  The implemented minifiers are high performance and streaming,
 which implies O(n).
 .
 The core functionality associates mimetypes with minification functions,
 allowing embedded resources (like CSS or JS within HTML files) to be
 minified as well. Users can add new implementations that are triggered
 based on a mimetype (or pattern), or redirect to an external command
 (like ClosureCompiler, UglifyCSS, ...)

Package: gosu
Description-md5: 72c0b42347139534207936c653f27fc4
Description-en: Simple Go-based setuid+setgid+setgroups+exec
 This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that "su" and "sudo" have
 very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior. They're
 also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of "sudo"),
 which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if all you need
 is "run this specific application as this specific user and get out of the
 pipeline".
 .
 The core of how "gosu" works is stolen directly from how Docker/libcontainer
 itself starts an application inside a container (and in fact, is using the
 "/etc/passwd" processing code directly from libcontainer's codebase).
 .
 Once the user/group is processed, we switch to that user, then we "exec" the
 specified process and "gosu" itself is no longer resident or involved in the
 process lifecycle at all. This avoids all the issues of signal passing and TTY,
 and punts them to the process invoking "gosu" and the process being invoked by
 "gosu", where they belong.

 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 This is GnuPG's signature verification tool, gpgv, built statically
 so that it can be directly used on any platform that is running on
 the Linux kernel.  Android and ChromeOS are two well known examples,
 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature
 verification that is present in all official Debian mirrors.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

Description-md5: 9f57ab3d18417d8eacccdce6026304cc
Description-en: image processing libraries providing ImageMagick interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

 translate addresses using the "traditional prefix" algorithm defined in RFC
 6052, and/or the Explicit Address Mapping algorithm defined in RFC 7757.
 .
 The `jool` module implements Stateful NAT64, a translator that can achieve 1
 (IPv4)-to-N (IPv6) relationships through a mapping strategy based on stateful
 NAT. Its full address translation algorithm is defined in RFC 6146.

 This package comes with a command-line tool ksuid, useful for generating
 KSUIDs as well as inspecting the internal components of existing KSUIDs.
 Machine-friendly output is provided for scripting use cases.
 .
 What is a KSUID?
 .
 KSUID is for K-Sortable Unique IDentifier. It is a kind of globally
 unique identifier similar to a RFC 4122 UUID, built from the ground-up
 to be "naturally" sorted by generation timestamp without any special
 type-aware logic.
 .
 In short, running a set of KSUIDs through the UNIX sort command will
 result in a list ordered by generation time.
 .
 Why use KSUIDs?
 .
 There are numerous methods for generating unique identifiers, so why
 KSUID?
 .
  1. Naturally ordered by generation time
  2. Collision-free, coordination-free, dependency-free
  3. Highly portable representations
 .

Description-en: Analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient
 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain
 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte
 code instructions, in particular.
 .
 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program
 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more
 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.
 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to
 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class
 files.

 make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g., TFTP send

Description-en: Apache Commons Net (API documentation)
 The Apache Commons Net library implements the client side of many basic
 Internet protocols. The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental
 protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore, some of the
 design violates object-oriented design principles. The philosophy is to
 make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g., TFTP send
 file and receive file) when possible, but also provide access to the
 fundamental protocols where applicable so that a programmer may construct
 his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP packet classes and the TFTP
 packet send and receive methods are exposed).

Package: libgraphics-magick-perl
Description-md5: 694d24fef1105bb316b3f9173117fd3c
Description-en: format-independent image processing - perl interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.

 This package contains the classes to access GraphicsMagick functionality from
 Perl scripts. It is mostly similar to PerlMagick from the ImageMagick suite,
 but uses a different class name.

Description-en: GStreamer OpenCV libraries
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

Description-md5: 3cf8ed7e757b9244dc8826f7bf3f2b29
Description-en: GStreamer development files for libraries from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

Description-en: module for removing scripts from HTML
 HTML::StripScripts is a Perl module for neutralizes scripting constructs in
 HTML, leaving as much non-scripting markup in place as possible. This allows
 web applications to display HTML originating from an untrusted source without
 introducing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
 .
 The process is based on whitelists of tags, attributes and attribute values.
 This approach is the most secure against disguised scripting constructs hidden
 in malicious HTML documents.
 .
 As well as removing scripting constructs, this module ensures that there is a
 matching end for each start tag, and that the tags are properly nested.
 .
 You will probably use HTML::StripScripts::Parser rather than using this module
 directly (see libhtml-stripscripts-parser-perl).

Package: libpam-malcontent
Description-md5: f906325285c7c36037b22ab8acfb195a
Description-en: PAM module to control the time a user is spending on the computer
 malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible
 to non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is used,
 a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
 administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
 will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
 being too violent.
 .
 This is not a security boundary, and a sufficiently technically advanced user
 may always work around these parental controls. malcontent is not a mandatory
 access control (MAC) system like AppArmor or SELinux. However, its correct use
 by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or
 accidentally having access to content which they shouldn’t.

Description-en: Java bindings for protocol buffers
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the Java bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Java classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the development files.

 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description-en: FFmpeg library for image scaling and various conversions - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Package: license-detector
Description-md5: 6dbbf3e5d1e2fe29a2325bceadb26b87
Description-en: Reliable project licenses detector (command line)
 It scans the given directory for license files, normalizes and hashes them
 and outputs all the fuzzy matches with the list of reference texts.  The
 returned names follow SPDX standard.
 .
 Why? There are no similar projects which can be compiled into a native binary
 without dependencies and also support the whole SPDX license database
 (≈400 items). This implementation is also fast, requires little memory, and
 the API is easy to use.
 .
 The detection algorithm is not template matching; this directly implies that
 go-license-detector does not provide any legal guarantees. The intended area
 of it's usage is data mining.
 .
 This package provides the command line interface.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, documentation
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package contains all documentation (extensive).

 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, documentation
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.

 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).

Description-en: compression program with a very high compression ratio
 A compression program that can achieve very high compression
 ratios and speed when used with large files. It uses the combined
 compression algorithms of zpaq and lzma for maximum compression, lzo
 for maximum speed, and the long range redundancy reduction of rzip.
 It is designed to scale with increases with RAM size, improving
 compression further. A choice of either size or speed optimizations
 allows for either better compression than even lzma can provide, or
 better speed than gzip, but with bzip2 sized compression levels.

 ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it
 exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records
 the dynamic library calls which are called by
 the executed process and the signals received by that process.
 It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
 .
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.
 .
 You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the
 execution of processes.

 malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible
 to non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is used,
 a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
 administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
 will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
 being too violent.
 .
 This is not a security boundary, and a sufficiently technically advanced user
 may always work around these parental controls. malcontent is not a mandatory
 access control (MAC) system like AppArmor or SELinux. However, its correct use
 by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or
 accidentally having access to content which they shouldn’t.

Package: mender-client
Description-md5: f63cb2510c63afcdfdc6f0f55a578cad
Description-en: Mender over-the-air software updater client.
 Mender: over-the-air updater for embedded Linux devices
 .
 Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded
 Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as
 well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.
 .
 Embedded product teams often end up creating homegrown updaters
 at the last minute due to the need to fix bugs in field-deployed
 devices. However, the most important requirement for an embedded update
 process is robustness, for example loss of power at any time should not
 brick a device. This creates a challenge given the time constraints to
 develop and maintain a homegrown updater.
 .
 Mender aims to address this challenge with a robust and easy to use
 updater for embedded Linux devices, which is open source and available
 to anyone.
 .
 Robustness is ensured with atomic image-based deployments using a dual
 A/B rootfs partition layout. This makes it always possible to roll
 back to a working state, even when losing power at any time during the
 update process.
 .
 Ease of use is addressed with an intuitive UI, comprehensive documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/), a meta layer for the Yocto Project
 (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender) for easy integration
 into existing environments, and high quality software (see the test
 coverage badge).
 .
 This repository contains the Mender client updater, which can be run in
 standalone mode (manually triggered through its command line interface)
 or managed mode (connected to the Mender server).
 .
 Mender not only provides the client-side updater, but also the backend and
 UI for managing deployments as open source. The Mender server is designed
 as a microservices architecture and comprises several repositories.
 .
 To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting
 started section in the Mender documentation (https://docs.mender.io/).
 .
 In order to support rollback, the Mender client depends on integration
 with U-Boot and the partition layout. It is therefore most easily
 built as part of your Yocto Project image by using the meta layer for
 the Yocto Project (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender).

Package: nbd-client
Description-md5: 50b5081db709f9bc399b8b74366d1d8f
Description-en: Network Block Device protocol - client
 Network Block Device (NBD) is a client/server protocol that
 emulates a block device (such as a hard disk, a floppy, or a CD-ROM)
 over the network, thus giving the system the ability to swap over the
 network, or to use raw network disk space for other purposes.
 .
 However, writing to one Network Block Device from different clients
 simultaneously is not recommended, and would probably result in data
 loss. If you want multiple clients to share a remote resource, use a
 network file system such as NFS or Coda.
 .
 This package provides the client binary for NBD.

Package: ncbi-entrez-direct
Description-md5: 10c6a6866d4021f4e8969018b2d1adbc
Description-en: NCBI Entrez utilities on the command line
 Entrez Direct (EDirect) is an advanced method for accessing NCBI's set
 of interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene,
 variation, expression, etc.) from a terminal window or script.
 Functions take search terms from command-line arguments.  Individual
 operations are combined to build multi-step queries.  Record retrieval
 and formatting normally complete the process.
 .
 EDirect also provides an argument-driven function that simplifies the
 extraction of data from document summaries or other results that are
 returned in structured XML format.  This can eliminate the need for
 writing custom software to answer ad hoc questions.  Queries can move
 seamlessly between EDirect commands and UNIX utilities or scripts to
 perform actions that cannot be accomplished entirely within Entrez.

Description-en: tool for running and interacting with trusted collections
 Notary is a project that allows anyone to have trust over arbitrary
 collections of data.
 .
 The Notary project comprises a server (cmd/notary-server) and a client
 (cmd/notary) for running and interacting with trusted collections.
 .
 Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
 publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
 with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
 enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.
 .
 With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
 secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
 push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.
 .
 Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure
 channel, can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror,
 relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity
 of the received content.
 .
 This package contains the binaries/tools.

 control over how they build container images, including:
  - Instead of building one layer per line, run all instructions in the
    same container
  - Set HostConfig settings like network and memory controls that are
    not available when running container builds
  - Mount external files into the build that are not persisted as part
    of the final image (i.e. "secrets")
  - If there are no RUN commands in the Dockerfile, the container is
    created and committed, but never started.  The final image should be
    99.9% compatible with regular container builds, but bugs are always
    possible.

Package: prometheus-pushgateway
Description-md5: 95fbeb244faa98192d9c460610063023
Description-en: Prometheus exporter for ephemereal jobs
 The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose
 their metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long
 enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway.
 The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus.
 .
 The Pushgateway is explicitly not an aggregator, but rather a metrics cache.
 It does not have a statsd-like semantics. The metrics pushed are exactly the
 same as you would present for scraping in a permanently running program.
 .
 For machine-level metrics, the textfile collector of prometheus-node-exporter
 is usually more appropriate. The Pushgateway is best used for service-level
 metrics.

Description-md5: 306158c67df1c70aca079d38e0afc1e3
Description-en: backup program with multiple revisions, encryption and more
 restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the following
 principles in mind:
    - Easy: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you might
 be tempted to skip it.  Restic should be easy to configure and use, so
 that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore it. Likewise,
 restoring data should not be complicated.
    - Fast: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your
 network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.
 Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring backups should
 only transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored, so
 that this process is also fast.
    - Verifiable: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic enables
 you to easily verify that all data can be restored.
    - Secure: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and
 integrity of your data. The location the backup data is stored is assumed
 not to be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where others like
 system administrators are able to access your backups). Restic is
 built to secure your data against such attackers.
    - Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only take
 the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate data should be
 de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage back end to save
 precious backup space.

Package: ripgrep
Description-md5: 45d1dfa98f350bc31d65169b0acf761d
Description-en: Recursively searches directories for a regex pattern
 ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current
 directory for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore rules and
 automatically skip hidden files/directories (smart filtering) and binary files.
 ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack
 and grep.
 .
 ripgrep is generally faster than both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep. It
 defaults to recursive directory search and won't search files ignored by your
 `.gitignore` files. Use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
 bugs, and Unicode support.
 .
 On the other hand, if you like multiline search, then ripgrep may not quite
 meet your needs (yet), and it will never support fancy regex features such as
 backreferences or lookaround

Package: sia
Description-md5: ad065d9d74c6eb3eeeab33e17b67e849
Description-en: Blockchain-based marketplace for file storage
 Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform aimed at giving users
 control of their data. Data is split into hundreds of erasure coded
 pieces and encrypted locally, and then each piece is uploaded to a
 separate host. A blockchain is used to create cryptographic contracts
 ensuring that hosts will only get paid if they actually store the
 data. Out of hundreds of hosts, only a fraction are required to
 recover the original file.
 .
 Anybody can join the network as a host and get income from the
 storage they contribute. This openness allows Sia to build and take
 advantage of a global network of small datacenters. Combined with
 advanced algorithms for storing and retrieving data, Sia is poised to
 be a highly competitive cloud storage platform. More information
 about the technology can be found on our website and in the 'doc'
 folder of the repo.
 .
 Sia is ready for use with small sums of money and non-critical files,
 but until the network has a more proven track record, we advise
 against using it as a sole means of storing important data.

Description-en: fast, cost-effective and scalable time series database
 VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable time-series database.
 It can be used as long-term remote storage for Prometheus.
 .
 Prominent features:
  * Supports Prometheus querying API, so it can be used as Prometheus
    drop-in replacement in Grafana. VictoriaMetrics implements MetricsQL
    query language, which is inspired by PromQL.
  * Supports global query view. Multiple Prometheus instances may write
    data into VictoriaMetrics. Later this data may be used in a single query.
  * High performance and good scalability for both inserts and selects.
    Outperforms InfluxDB and TimescaleDB by up to 20x.
  * Uses 10x less RAM than InfluxDB when working with millions of unique time
    series (aka high cardinality).
  * Optimized for time series with high churn rate. Think about
    prometheus-operator metrics from frequent deployments in Kubernetes.
  * High data compression, so up to 70x more data points may be crammed into
    limited storage comparing to TimescaleDB.
  * Optimized for storage with high-latency IO and low IOPS (HDD and network
    storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc).
  * A single-node VictoriaMetrics may substitute moderately sized clusters
    built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or
    TimescaleDB.
  * Easy operation:
    - VictoriaMetrics consists of a single small executable without external
      dependencies.
    - All the configuration is done via explicit command-line flags with
      reasonable defaults.
    - All the data is stored in a single directory pointed by
      -storageDataPath flag.
    - Easy and fast backups from instant snapshots to S3 or GCS with
      vmbackup / vmrestore.
    - Data migration between VictoriaMetrics, Prometheus and InfluxDB with
      vmctl.
  * Storage is protectedfrom corruption on unclean shutdown (i.e. OOM,
    hardware reset or kill -9) thanks to the storage architecture.
  * Supports metrics' scraping, ingestion and backfilling (#backfilling)
    via the following protocols:
    - Metrics from Prometheus exporters such as node_exporter.
    - Prometheus remote write API
    - InfluxDB line protocol
    - Graphite plaintext protocol with tags if -graphiteListenAddr is set.
    - OpenTSDB put message if -opentsdbListenAddr is set.
    - HTTP OpenTSDB /api/put requests if -opentsdbHTTPListenAddr is set.
    - /api/v1/import.
  * Ideally works with big amounts of time series data from Kubernetes, IoT
    sensors, connected cars, industrial telemetry, financial data and
    various Enterprise workloads.
  * Has open source cluster version.

 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth

 xxdiff is a powerful tool for viewing the differences between two or three
 files, or two directories, and can be used to produce a merged version.  The
 texts of the two or three files are presented side by side with their
 differences highlighted with colors for easy identification.
 .
 This package provides a number of scripts that are used to perform a variety of
 tasks that all involve getting user verification and feedback using the xxdiff
 graphical differences viewer.
 .
 For example, there are scripts to perform global renaming of strings within a
 large codebase, where each transformed file is viewed by the user with an
 xxdiff, accepted, rejected or merged changes written over the original file
 (making backups is supported).  Also, this infrastructure is mostly provided as
 modules, in order to allow users to write file transformations in Python and to
 leverage this interactive confirmation process.
 .
 There are also scripts that visualize diffs for a number of SCM systems, like
 CVS, Subversion, etc.  This package was born after a number of these useful
 scripts had sprouted, and it became apparent that sharing the common code for
 the scripts would be a great advantage to tools writers.
 .
